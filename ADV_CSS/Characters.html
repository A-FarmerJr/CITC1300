        <h3 class="h3char"><i>Portrayed by Kyle Maclachlan</i></h3>
        <img src=images/DaleCooper.jpg alt="Dale Cooper" id=cooper_img>
        <p>Dale Cooper from <i>Twin Peaks (1990-2017)</i> begins as a sharp-minded FBI agent investigating the murder of Laura Palmer in a seemingly quaint small town. His quirky habits—like savoring black coffee and cherry pie—contrast with the darkness he uncovers, from supernatural entities to the sinister Black Lodge. Cooper’s unique investigative methods, such as Tibetan meditation and dream analysis, lead him into a surreal realm where he confronts his own shadow self. The Black Lodge, with its red curtains and backward-speaking inhabitants, becomes a psychological battleground, stripping away his moral certainty. By the end of the original series, Cooper is possessed by the malevolent BOB, his purity shattered in a haunting descent into madness. His journey embodies psychological horror’s core: the unraveling of a stable mind in the face of the unknown.</p>

        <h2 class="character_name">Heather Mason</h2>
        <h3 class="h3char"><i>Portrayed by Heather Morris</i></h3>
        <p>Heather Mason, the protagonist of <i>Silent Hill 3 (2003)</i>, is a teenage girl thrust into a nightmarish world of fog and rust, where her own identity becomes her greatest enemy. Born as a reincarnation of Alessa Gillespie, Heather is haunted by her past, battling grotesque monsters that symbolize her inner turmoil and repressed memories. The Otherworld—a hellish dimension of decay and despair—forces her to confront her fractured sense of self, as she uncovers her connection to the cult of Silent Hill. Her journey is one of survival and self-discovery, marked by moments of raw vulnerability and fierce determination. Armed with little more than a steel pipe and a radio that crackles with static, Heather navigates a town that mirrors her psyche, making her a poignant figure in psychological horror. Her story highlights the genre’s ability to turn personal trauma into a tangible, terrifying landscape.</p>
