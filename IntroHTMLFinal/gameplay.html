                <h2>Mastering Time and Choices</h2>
                <p>The core mechanic of *Life is Strange* is Max’s time-rewind ability, which allows players to reverse decisions and explore different outcomes. For example, during conversations, players can rewind to choose a different dialogue option, impacting how characters react and how the story unfolds. This mechanic also applies to puzzles, such as rewinding to avoid danger or gather information—like finding a key hidden in a different timeline. The game emphasizes choice and consequence, with major decisions tracked in Max’s journal, showing players how their actions ripple through the narrative. Some choices lead to immediate consequences, while others have long-term effects, such as deciding whether to intervene in a bullying incident involving Kate Marsh.</p>
                <p>Beyond time manipulation, gameplay involves exploration and interaction. Players can examine objects in the environment, like Max’s camera or Chloe’s belongings, to uncover story details and character insights. The game’s point-and-click style encourages players to take their time, soaking in the atmosphere of Arcadia Bay while solving mysteries. The emotional weight of decisions, combined with the time-rewind mechanic, creates a unique gameplay experience that balances player agency with narrative depth.</p>
