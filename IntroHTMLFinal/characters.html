                <h2>Max Caulfield and Chloe Price</h2>
                <p>Max Caulfield, the game’s protagonist, is an 18-year-old photography student at Blackwell Academy. Known for her shy demeanor and love of Polaroid cameras, Max is a deeply empathetic character who struggles with self-doubt and the weight of her time-rewind ability. Her journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to balance her powers with her desire to protect those she loves. Max’s introspective nature is reflected in her journal, where she documents her thoughts and sketches, giving players insight into her emotional state.</p>
                <p>Chloe Price, Max’s childhood best friend, is a 19-year-old punk with a rebellious streak. With her blue hair, leather jacket, and tough attitude, Chloe hides a vulnerable side shaped by the loss of her father and her mother’s remarriage. Her friendship with Max is the heart of the story, as they reconnect after years apart, facing danger and heartbreak together. Chloe’s impulsive nature often puts her at odds with Max’s caution, but their bond grows stronger through shared trials.</p>
